📁 CPU Scheduling Algorithms

This repository contains C implementations of fundamental CPU scheduling algorithms:

    First Come First Serve (FCFS)

    Round Robin (RR)

    Shortest Job First (SJF)

The project uses a Makefile for easy compilation and management of source files. Each algorithm is implemented with simplicity and clarity in mind, making this project ideal for students and enthusiasts learning about process scheduling in operating systems.

🔧 Features

    Modular C code for each scheduling algorithm

    Easy build system using make

    Sample input/output handling for testing and demonstration

🛠️ Build & Run
